      <p>
        Tessel runs every session in a sandbox, but some actions reach outside it: pushing a branch, opening a pull request, calling a
        paid API. Approval policies decide which of those run on their own, which wait for a person and which are never allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Policies live in <code>tessel.toml</code> next to your code, so they are reviewed like any other change. Workspace admins can
        add an org-wide floor that repositories can tighten but never loosen.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-it-works">How approvals work</h2>
      <p>
        Before a tool call leaves the sandbox, Tessel matches it against your rules from top to bottom. The first rule that matches
        wins. When nothing matches, the <code>default</code> applies.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The agent proposes a call with its exact arguments.</li>
        <li>Tessel looks up the decision for that tool and those arguments.</li>
        <li>
          An <strong>ask</strong> decision pauses the session and shows an approval card in the workspace, Slack and the PR thread.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This policy lets Tessel run tests and builds freely, asks before anything touches <code>main</code> and blocks destructive
        shell commands outright.

      </div>
      <p>
        Check it with <code>tessel policy check</code>. The command prints each rule with the calls from your last ten sessions it
        would have matched.

      <h2 id="remembered">Remembered decisions</h2>
      <p>
        Choosing <strong>Always allow</strong> on an approval card writes a remembered rule scoped to the repository and tool. You can
        review and revoke remembered rules under <a href="#">Settings → Approvals</a>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Remembered rules never apply to high-risk tools. Those ask every time, by design.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="audit">Auditing decisions</h2>
      <p>
        Every decision is recorded with the approver, the arguments and the policy line that matched. Export the log as CSV, or stream
        it to your SIEM with the <a href="#">audit webhook</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Logs are kept for 400 days on Team and indefinitely on Enterprise.</li>
        <li>Denied calls include the agent&apos;s next step, so you can see how it recovered.</li>
