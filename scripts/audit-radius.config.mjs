/**
 * Config for scripts/audit-radius.mjs.
 *
 * actions: interactions run after the resting audit on a page, each followed by a re-measure.
 *   { page: "<docs name>", selector, type: "hover" | "click" | "contextmenu", nth?, wait?,
 *     thenHover?, thenHoverNth? }
 *   `selector` is a Playwright selector; only visible matches count (`nth` picks among them).
 *   Clicks are closed with Escape afterwards. `thenHover` hovers a row inside what the click
 *   opened (a menu item) and measures again. Keep the list small: one per surface that only
 *   shows a rounded child on interaction.
 *
 * allow: intentional findings to drop from the report. Every field is optional and all given
 *   fields must match: { page, scope (example id | "main-demo" | "site" | "portal" | "gallery"),
 *   slot, ancestorSlot, selector (substring of the reported selector), control (true for buttons,
 *   inputs, tabs, icon chips, badges, kbd), minInset (every flagged corner is inset ≥ this many px),
 *   level ("must" | "should"), reason }.
 *   Always give a reason; see notes/radius-audit.md for the triage behind each entry.
