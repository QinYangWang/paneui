                A good default lets someone finish the task without studying the settings. The page opens, the text reads, the link can be
                shared. That is most of the work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything else is a choice you are handing over. Offer it only when a need shows up, and leave the rest to the people who
                already know they need it.

                Nested corners are the small version of this. Put a rounded panel inside another one with a little padding between them and
                give both the same radius, and something feels off: the inner corners look too sharp, and the gap bulges at each corner.
              </p>
              <p>
                A corner radius describes a circle. Two arcs with the same radius but different centres drift apart by roughly{" "}
                <code>0.41 × radius</code> at the corner. One line fixes it: the outer radius is the inner one plus the padding. A{" "}
                <code>12px</code> panel in a <code>4px</code> frame takes <code>16px</code>.
              </p>

                The rule holds for shapes your eye compares directly. Past about 24px of padding the layers stop reading as one object, and
                each keeps the radius it would have on its own.
